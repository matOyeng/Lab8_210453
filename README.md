Lab 8: Photo Album App

In this lab session, you will learn how to use sensors on your phone. 

You will build a private photo album in which the users shall be able to take photos from the phone camera or album and then store in the private photo album. 

Your app should prompt users for a PIN as the first screen. If the biometric sensors exist on the user's phone, it will prompt the user for biometric authentication as the alternative option. Once authenticated, the app shall present the users a dashboard with 4 recent photos. There will be a 'Add Photo' button so that the user could take a photo from the camera or album. Once a photo is taken, the user shall be able to add a description to the the photo, device GPS location, Date Time, and Folder (Collection) Name, then tap the "Save" button to go back to the dashboard. Use the knowledge learned in the previous labs, store these information in a database.

Also, add some functions to manage the album, such as updating the photo description, delete photo, moving the photo from one folder to another.

Adjust your GUI, use a darker theme if the ambient light is dark, and a lighter theme otherwise.
